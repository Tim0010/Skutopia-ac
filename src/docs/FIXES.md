# Mentorly Academia Application Fixes

This document details the fixes implemented to resolve issues with mentor creation, admin access, and database relations in the Mentorly Academia application.

## Authentication and Login Issues

We've improved the login process to better handle authentication errors:

1. Enhanced error messaging and fallbacks for development environments
2. Added proper session handling to ensure authenticated requests
3. Implemented development mode fallbacks to allow testing without real credentials

## Admin API Access

The application was facing 403 errors when trying to access the Admin API. We've fixed this by:

1. Updating the `useUsers` hook to gracefully handle non-admin access
2. Providing fallbacks for email data when admin privileges aren't available
3. Adding proper type checking to prevent runtime errors

## Mentor Creation Errors

The 401 errors during mentor creation were fixed by:

1. Adding proper session validation before attempting to create mentors
2. Connecting mentors to the authenticated user via the `user_id` field
3. Implementing better error handling for permission issues
4. Ensuring proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies are in place

## Row Level Security Policies

We've created comprehensive RLS policies to secure the mentor-related tables:

1. Fixed viewable permissions to allow everyone to see mentors and their records
2. Added insert/update/delete permissions restricted to the authenticated owner
3. Ensured proper relations between mentor and related tables
4. Added the necessary `user_id` column to the mentors table

## Database Schema Updates

We've updated the code to match the actual database schema:

1. Fixed property name mismatches (`booking_date` â†’ `date`)
2. Removed non-existent fields (`session_price`)
3. Added backward compatibility for different naming conventions (`type`/`resource_type`)
4. Enhanced queries to properly handle table relations

## How to Apply These Fixes

### 1. Database Schema and Permissions

Run the SQL migration to fix table relations and permissions:

```bash
# Option 1: Apply manually in Supabase dashboard
# Copy the SQL from src/sql/permissions_fix.sql and run it in the Supabase SQL editor

# Option 2: Use the apply_permission_fixes.js script
# First, set your environment variables in .env:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

npm install dotenv @supabase/supabase-js
node src/scripts/apply_permission_fixes.js
```

### 2. Code Updates

The following files have been updated:

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Improved login function with better error handling
- `src/hooks/useUsers.tsx`: Fixed admin API access issues
- `src/services/mentorService.ts`: Enhanced mentor creation and management
- `src/services/adminMentorService.ts`: Fixed relation handling in admin functions

### 3. Testing

After applying these fixes:

1. Try logging in with valid credentials
2. Test creating a new mentor
3. Verify that admin pages work correctly (with graceful degradation for non-admins)
4. Check that bookings and feedback can be created and retrieved properly

## Notes for Developers

- The application now includes proper fallbacks for development mode
- Row Level Security is enforced at the database level
- All mentor-related operations require authentication
- The `user_id` column must be set when creating mentors to establish ownership
